  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> <span id="last-updated"></span></p>

  <p>Multiple In One ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
     explains what information the app collects, how it is used, and your choices. By using the app, you agree
     to this Policy.</p>

  <h2>1. What This App Does</h2>
  <p>The app provides a collection of casual games and content, using an in‑app browser (WebView) to open
     external game pages. It also saves your basic preferences (like theme) locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>App Preferences</strong>: Theme selection and similar settings are stored locally using
        platform preferences (e.g., SharedPreferences on Android).</li>
    <li><strong>In‑App Browsing</strong>: When you open a game, the app loads an external website in a WebView
        (for example, domains operated by the game provider). Any data collected by those third‑party sites
        (such as cookies or device information) is controlled by their own privacy policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash/Diagnostics</strong>: We do not integrate third‑party analytics or crash reporting in the
        app. The operating system may generate diagnostic logs locally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To remember your preferences (e.g., dark/light theme).</li>
    <li>To open and display external game content inside the app's WebView.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>No account</strong> is created and we do <strong>not</strong> collect personal identifiers such as your name,
     email, or phone number within the app.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Preferences are stored locally on your device. We do not operate a backend server for your data.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for securing your device to protect local data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Third‑Party Content and Links</h2>
  <p>The app opens games hosted by third parties (for example: game portals). Those websites may collect
     information according to their own policies (e.g., cookies, web storage). We do not control and are not
     responsible for third‑party practices. Please review the privacy policy displayed on the sites you visit.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The app is intended for a general audience. If you are under the age where parental consent is required by
     law in your region, you should only use the app with the permission and supervision of a parent or guardian.
     We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can change or reset preferences within the app (e.g., toggle theme).</li>
    <li>You can clear the app’s data in your device settings to remove locally stored preferences.</li>
    <li>You can stop using the app at any time by uninstalling it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version in the app or in this
     document and revise the “Last Updated” date.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions or requests regarding this Privacy Policy, contact us at
